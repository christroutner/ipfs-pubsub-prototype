This article is for an IPFS boilerplate that I'm working on. You can
find [the source code here](https://github.com/christroutner/gatsby-ipfs-boilerplate).
The idea is to create a 'boilerplate' starter template that people can easily
adapt to build their own IPFS-ready websites that can be distributed in a
censorship-resistant manner.

All code is published under the MIT license, which means you are free to modify
the code and share your changes with anyone you want. You can charge money for
it too. The power is in your hands.
